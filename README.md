# Space-Exploration-Site
 Space Exploration Site This is a sample website for a space exploration company, built with HTML and CSS. The site uses the Google Fonts API to load the 'Orbitron' font family with two different weights (400 and 800) and includes a CSS file called 'styles.css' that sets the font family to 'Orbitron' for the entire document and applies various styles to different elements.  The site features a header section with links to the font files and the CSS file, as well as a body section with a main content area and a footer section. The main content area includes a hero section with a background image of a galaxy, a logo, a title with an underline effect, and a button with the text 'Apply'. The hero section uses various CSS styles to position and style its elements, including padding, text shadow, and font weight.  The site is designed to be responsive and adjust to different screen sizes and devices. It has been tested on various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and functionality.
